    A PUS policy is an object defining various properties of the PUS implementation,
    e.g., various field lengths. This is due to that many parts of the PUS standard
    are mission-specific.

    The PUS policy is set on a global scope, thus, multiple simultaneous PUS policies
    are not supported. Might need to be reviewed in the future.
